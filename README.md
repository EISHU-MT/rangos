## Introduction

XP, Ranks and Shop mod:
An experiencie (XP) system is implemented that allows players to obtain default or custom rewards at each level. In addition, a shop is incorporated where players can both sell and buy items using XP. Ranks are acquired by leveling up.

## Features:

### XP Acquisition from Mining Ores:

Players can earn experience points (XP) by mining ores, with a predefined amount awarded for each ore. The following is a list detailing the XP values for each ore:

- `default:stone_with_coal = 1`
- `x_default:stone_with_lapis = 2`
- `default:stone_with_tin = 2`
- `default:stone_with_iron = 3`
- `default:stone_with_copper = 3`
- `default:stone_with_mese = 5`
- `default:stone_with_gold = 5`
- `default:stone_with_diamond = 8`
- `legendary_ore:legendary_ore = 5`
- `rainbow_ore:rainbow_ore_block = 5`
- `moreores:mineral_mithril = 3`
- `moreores:mineral_silver = 3`
- `lapis:stone_with_lapis = 2`
- `atium:atium_ore = 3`

### XP Acquisition from Defeating Entities (Mobs/Monsters/Players [+10%]):

Players can accumulate XP by defeating entities (mobs/monsters) or eliminating other players. When killing another player, the assailant gains 10% of the victim's XP. Below is a list detailing the XP values granted by each entity upon demise:

- Dirt Monster (`mobs_monster:dirt_monster`) = 7
- Dungeon Master (`mobs_monster:dungeon_master`) = 40
- Oerkki mobs (`monster:oerkki`) = 12
- Sand Monster (`mobs_monster:sand_monster`) = 7
- Stone Monster (`mobs_monster:stone_monster`) = 5
- Tree Monster (`mobs_monster:tree_monster`) = 5
- Lava Flan (`mobs_monster:lava_flan`) = 12
- Mese Monster (`mobs_monster:mese_monster`) = 3
- Spider (`mobs_monster:spider`) = 6
- Land Guard (`mobs_monster:land_guard`) = 15
- Fire Spirit (`mobs_monster:fire_spirit`) = 10
- Balrog (`spawners_mobs:balrog`) = 500
- Bunny Evil (`spawners_mobs:bunny_evil`) = 5
- Mummy (`spawners_mobs:mummy`) = 14
- Uruk Hai (`spawners_mobs:uruk_hai`) = 14
- Bat (`mobs_bat:bat`) = 14

Welcome any assistance in adding mobs from other mods.

### XP Acquisition from Selling in the Shop:

Players can use the XP store to buy or sell in-game items, with XP as the currency. To sell items, players need to have the item in hand and use the command `/sell <price>` (with a price limit of 4999). The command `/shop` is used to access the shop.

It's worth noting that the store functions offline; sellers can list their items, disconnect, and if a buyer makes a purchase, the seller will receive the payment (XP) upon reconnecting (or instantly if the seller is online). All information is updated and saved with each transaction and server shutdown.

### XP Loss on Death (-10%)

### Level-Up Ranks:

In addition to receiving rewards as they advance through levels, players acquire special ranks according to their current level. The available ranks and the corresponding level to obtain them are detailed below:

- Newcomer = (1-3)
- Aspirant = (4-6)
- Freshman = (7-9)
- Wayfarer = (10-12)
- Voyager = (13-15)
- Trailblazer = (16-18)
- Citizen = (19-21)
- Veteran = (22-24)
- Master = (25-27)
- Hero = (28-30)
- Legend = (31-33)
- Mythic = (34-36)
- Supreme Master = (37-42)
- Champion = (43-âˆž)

### Level Rewards:

Players receive rewards upon reaching levels up to the official maximum set at level 43. Administrators can set custom rewards for specific levels using the `/xp_add_reward <level> <modname:itemname> <amount>` command. This command allows overwriting existing rewards. For example, if a reward is already assigned to level 12, using the command will replace it with the new reward specified by the administrator.

If no custom rewards have been set, levels contain default rewards. The following is a list of default rewards assigned from level 2 to level 43:

| Level | Item                        | Amount |
